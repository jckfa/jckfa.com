  Jack did an interview with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nixbenson/" target="_blank">Nick Benson</a>, owner and creative director of <a href="https://www.johnstevensshop.com/" target="_blank">The John Stevens Shop</a>, a design and stone-carving business founded in 1705 by John Stevens in Newport, Rhode Island. Nick is the third generation of a family of calligraphers and stone-carvers, and has continued developing his craft for four decades. The discussion explores Nick’s process, his guerrilla art ambitions, and the dark side of social media.
